Put your Project 5 brief explanation, as directed, here.

I am accessing the Tumblr search API and wish to gather the below info:

- Blog posts that are tagged with "vegan"
- for each post I also want to know the name of the blog, the note count and the tags
- Once I have that info about the tags I want to count the number of tags so I can see how popular each post was
- After the program is run the above info will be written to 2 separate CSV files per functions I made
- The first CSV called Tumblr_Blog.csv will have 3 columns ( Blog Name, Tags and Note_Count)
- The second CSV called Tumblr2_Tags.csv will have just 2 columns with the tag and the tag number( the number of times the tag was used)

- URL for the API: https://api.tumblr.com/v2/tagged
